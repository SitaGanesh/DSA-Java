// Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where the solution depends on solution to smaller instance of a same problem 

// steps to solve any recursion problem.
    // 1. Base Case
    // 2. Work
    // 3. Call inner function
// Recursion internally will be done with call stack, it is also called stack analysis.
